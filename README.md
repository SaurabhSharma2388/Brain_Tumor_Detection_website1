# Brain Tumor Detection 


Brain Tumor Detection model using a Support Vector Machine.

About the data:
The dataset contains 4 folders: yes and no which contains 400 Brain MRI Images. The folder yes contains 300 Brain MRI Images that are tumorous and the folder no contains 100 Brain MRI Images that are non-tumorous.

About the Brain Tumor
A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells within the brain or its surrounding tissue. There are two main types of brain tumors: primary and secondary. Some common types of primary brain tumors include:

-  Glioma Tumor- A glioma tumor is a type of brain tumor that originates from glial cells in the brain or spine.
*  Malignant Tumor- A malignant tumor is a type of cancerous growth that has the potential to invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body.
+  Pituitary Tumor - A pituitary tumor is an abnormal growth in the pituitary gland that can cause hormonal imbalances and other health problems.

# Accuracy Score
Now, the best model (the one with the best validation accuracy) detects brain tumor with:

95.36% with logistic Regression accuracy on the test set.
93.73% with Support Vector Machine score on the test set.
These resutls are very good considering that the data is balanced.
