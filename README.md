# Brain Tumor Detection 


Building a detection model using a Support Vector Machine.

About the data:
The dataset contains 4 folders: yes and no which contains 400 Brain MRI Images. The folder yes contains 300 Brain MRI Images that are tumorous and the folder no contains 100 Brain MRI Images that are non-tumorous.



# Accuracy Score
Now, the best model (the one with the best validation accuracy) detects brain tumor with:

95.36% with logistic Regression accuracy on the test set.
93.73% with Support Vector Machine score on the test set.
These resutls are very good considering that the data is balanced.

Performance table of the best model:
